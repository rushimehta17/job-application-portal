# Job Application Portal
In this project I have created a website using HTML, CSS, PHP.<br>
It will require xampp/wamp server and database.<br>
It stores information of job seekers like their skills and then the employers can search for specific types of skilled people.
All the people in the database that match their requirement will be shown to them.<br>
For admin all the crud applications are also implimented.<br>
Job available and registration are two tables you need to create in database, images of the structure of these databases are added.
